MacKenzie, Fully Online Clustering of Evolving Data Streams into Arbitrarily Shaped Clusters, submitted to Information Sciences, accepted for publication subject ot minor revision, Oct 2016.\r\n\r\nTwo version of Matlab code are available:\r\n\r\n1. Pre-2015b uses proprietry code to maintain minimal graph structure of the micro-clusters.\r\n\r\n2. Post 2015b uses Matlab's 'graph' function to maintain a full micro-cluster graph structure.\r\n\r\nThe second version runs slightly slower but allows for detailed display of the micro-cluster graph and supplies additional information that may be used for future applications of the CEDAS algorithm.",
