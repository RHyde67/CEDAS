Clustering of Evolving Data-streams into Arbitrary Shapes.

R. Hyde, P. Angelov, A.R. MacKenzie, Fully Online Clustering of Evolving Data Streams into Arbitrarily Shaped Clusters, submitted to Information Sciences, accepted for publication subject ot minor revision, Oct 2016.
This demo is available as supplementary data for the journal paper.

This version uses the 'graph' function available in Matlab 2015b and later.

Although the 'graph' function runs slower than the pre-2015b version of CEDAS the extra information created for the graphs allows for easy visual display of the graph structures aiding understanding of the underlying CEDAS function.

CEDAS.m is the basic function.

CEDAS_IS_Demo.m creates a random data stream, performs the clustering and displays the clustering results and the underlying graph structure.


The code has been written for clarity and not optimised for speed.
