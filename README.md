# CEDAS
Clustering of Evolving Data-streams into Arbitrary Shapes

This branch contains the first version of CEDAS for Matlab pre-2015b.

This version does not use the Matlab 'graph' function included with Matlab 2015b and on. The code runs faster, but does not easily enable visualization of the graph structure.
